c This is the control file for the GEANT simulation.  Parameters defined
c in this file control the kind and extent of simulation that is performed.
c The full list of options is given in section BASE-40 of the GEANT manual.
c
c In addition, some new cards have been defined to set up the input source
c for the simulation.  Three kinds of simulation runs are available, selected
c by which of the following three "cards" are present below.
c    1. Input from Monte Carlo generator (card INFILE)
c    2. Built-in coherent bremsstrahlung source (card BEAM)
c    3. Built-in single-track event generator (card KINE)
c The order of the list is significant, that is if INFILE is present then the
c BEAM and KINE cards are ignored, otherwise if BEAM is present then KINE is
c ignored.  For example, the 3-card sequence:
c     INFILE 'phi-1680.hddm'
c     SKIP 25
c     TRIG 100
c instructs HDGeant to open ./phi-1680.hddm, skip the first 25 events and then
c process the following 100 input events and stop.  If the end of the file is
c reached before the event count specified in card TRIG is exhausted then the
c processing will stop at the end of file.
TRIG 10000
cINFILE 'rhop.hddm'
cBEAM 12. 9.

c Commenting out the following line will disable simulated hits output.
OUTFILE 'hdgeant.hddm'

c The following card enables single-track generation (for testing).
c For a single-particle gun, set the momentum (GeV/c), direction
c theta,phi (degrees) and vertex position (cm), and for the particle
c type insert the Geant particle type code plus 100 (eg. 101=gamma,
c 103=electron, 107=pi0, 108=pi+, 109=pi-, 114=proton).  If you use
c the particle code but do not add 100 then theta,phi are ignored
c and the particle direction is generated randomly over 4pi sr.
c For a listing of the Geant particle types, see the following URL.
c http://wwwasdoc.web.cern.ch/wwwasdoc/geant_html3/node72.html
c The meaning of the arguments to KINE are as follows.
c  - particle = GEANT particle type of primary track + 100
c  - momentum = initial track momentum, central value (GeV/c)
c  - theta = initial track polar angle, central value (degrees)
c  - phi = initial track azimuthal angle, central value (degrees)
c  - delta_momentum = spread in initial track momentum, full width (GeV/c)
c  - delta_theta = spread in initial track polar angle, full width (degrees)
c  - delta_phi = spread in initial track azimuthal angle, full width (degrees)
c

c The SCAP card determines the vertex position for the particle gun.  It
c supports the following three arguments, all of which default to 0.
c
c    vertex_x vertex_y vertex_z
SCAP    0.       0.      0.

c If you specify a non-zero value for vertex_x and/or vertex_y above then
c all tracks will emerge from the given point.  If you leave them at zero,
c you have the option of specifying the HALO card which causes the simulation
c to generate events with a transverse profile modeled after the 12 GeV
c electron beam.  The argument only argument to HALO is fhalo, the fraction
c of the beam that lies in the halo region surrounding the core gaussian.
c The nominal value taken from CASA technical note JLAB-TN-06-048 is 5e-5.
c This card is only effective for electron beam simulations with gxtwist.

c The following lines control the rate (GHz) of background beam photons
c that are overlayed on each event in the simulation, in addition to the
c particles produced by the standard generation mechanism. BGGATE expects
c two values in ns, which define the window around the trigger time that
c background beam photons are overlaid on the simulation. The value you
c should enter for BGRATE depends on many details of the photon beam: the
c endpoint energy, the low-energy cutoff to be used in generating beam
c photons, the location of coherent edge, the electron beam spot size and
c emittance at the primary collimator, the electron beam current, etc. To
c find the setting that is right for you, follow these steps in order.
c  1) Check the BEAM card above that it has correct values for the electron
c     beam energy (field 1) and the low-energy cutoff that you want to use
c     in your simulation (field 3). Remember these values.
c  2) Open a new tab in a web browser and enter the following URL,
c     http://zeus.phys.uconn.edu/halld/cobrems/ratetool.cgi which displays
c     a form containing many fields describing the electron beam and the
c     photon beamline. Enter the correct values in all fields in the
c     left-most column of parameters. The right column of parameters 
c     defines the windows over which the tool will compute integrals of
c     the beam rate. Set the "end-point" window to span the full range
c     from your beamEmin (see step 1 above) to the electron beam endpoint,
c     Then click the Plot Spectrum button. After a few seconds, the form will
c     respond with a few plots and rate numbers in bold text. Record the
c     value given for the "end-point rate". This is your BGRATE value.
c  3) Enter your BGRATE value found in step 2 after BGRATE in the line
c     below, and remove any characters before the BGRATE keyword. You are
c     now ready to go. If you ever change anything in the beamline geometry
c     eg. the collimator diameter, the coherent edge position, or the value
c     of beamEmin, do not forget to come back and change your BGRATE.
cBGGATE -200. 200.

c The above cards BGRATE, BGGATE normally cause the simulation to add
c accidental tagger hits to the simulated output record, in addition to
c adding these beam photons to the list of particles to be tracked through
c the detector. If you want the accidental tagger hits to be added to the
c simulated output record but you do not want to track the background
c beam photons, remove the comment in front of BGTAGONLY below.
c NOTICE: If you turn on BGTAGONLY then you might as well raise the
c minimum energy of beam photons being generated to the lower bound of
c the tagger energy range you are interested in, which might be 3 GeV for
c low-intensity running, 7 GeV for high-intensity running, or even 8 GeV
c if you are only interested in the region of the coherent peak. This
c minimum is the third field of the BEAM card above. Remember that if
c you change beamEmin, you also need to change BGRATE to match, as 
c described above.

c The following card seeds the random number generator so it must be unique
c for each run.  There are two ways to specify the random see for a run.
c  1. One argument, must be an integer in the range [1,215]
c  2. Two arguments, must be a pair of positive Integer*4 numbers
c In the first case, one of a limited set of prepared starting seeds is
c chosen from a list.  These seeds have been certified to produce random
c sequences that do not repeat within the first 10^9 or so random numbers.
c For cases where more choices are needed, the two-argument form gives
c access to a total of 2^62 choices, with no guarantees about closed loops.

c The following line controls a set of generic flags that are used to
c control aspects of the simulation generally related to debugging.
c For normal debugging runs these should be left at zero (or omitted).
c At present the following functionality is defined (assumes debug on).
c  SWIT(2) = 0 turns off trajectory tracing
c          = 2 turns on step-by-step trace during tracking (verbose!)
c          = 3 turns on trajectory plotting after tracking is done
c          = 4 turns on step-by-step plotting during tracking
c  SWIT(3) = 1 stores track trajectories for plotting after tracking is done

c The following cards are needed if optical photons are being
c being generated and tracked in the simulation.  The CKOV directive
c enables Cerenkov generation in materials for which the refractive
c index table has been specified.  The LABS card enables absorption
c of optical photons.  The ABAN directive controls a special feature
c of Geant which allows it to "abandon" tracking of charged particles
c once their remaining range drops below the distance to the next
c discrete interaction or geometric boundary.  Particles abandoned
c during tracking are stopped immediately and dump all remaining energy
c where they lie.  The remaining energy is dumped in the correct volume
c so this is OK in most cases, but it can cut into the yield of
c Cerenkov photons (eg. in a lead glass calorimeter) at the end of
c a particle track.  If this might be important, set ABAN to 0.
CKOV 1
LABS 1

c The following card prevents GEANT tracking code from abandoning the
c tracking of particles near the end of their range, once it determines
c that their fate is just to stop (i.e. electrons and protons).  This
c behaviour is normal in most cases, but in the case of Cerenkov light
c generation it leads to an underestimate for the yields.
c   ABAN 1	abandon stopping tracks (default)
c   ABAN 0	do not abandon stopping tracks
ABAN 0

c The following card sets up the simulation to perform debugging on
c a subset of the simulated events.
c DEBUG first last step
c  - first (int) = event number of first event to debug
c  - last (int) = event number of last event to debug
c  - step (int) = only debug one event every step events

c The following card can be used to turn off generation of secondary
c particles in the simulation, ordinarily it should be 0 (or omitted).

c The following card tells the simulation to store particle trajectories
c in the output file.  This output can be verbose, use with caution.
