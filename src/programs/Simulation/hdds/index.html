<P><LI>What it does:<BR>
The goal of this project is to develop a proposal for a XML-based
geometry specification for the Hall D detector and beam line.  The
immediate need for a specification is to have a single reference for
geometrical parameters used in Monte Carlo simulations.  Eventually
one can imagine a longer list of clients who may need geometrical
information.

<P><LI>What goes in:<BR>
The objective is to group together all of the static properties of
the detector and encapsulate them all under one document.  These
<I>static properties</I> are any features of the detector that are
specified or measured apart from the physics data themselves.  Features
that are extracted from the data themselves are generically known as
<I>calibration constants</I>; these are set apart from the
geometry because they are of interest to a smaller set of client
applications, and are generally more volatile by nature than something
that can be specified in a design.  Properties like the thickness of the
exit window to the target, or the magnetic field map inside the solenoid
are examples of what goes into HDDS.  Properties like the average light
output by a pion in the Cerenkov detector or dE/dx of a MIP in the
central tracking chamber are examples of calibration constants that
do not go into HDDS.

<P><LI>What inspired it:<BR>
All modern experiments employ some kind of database for storing geometrical
constants.  The idea of using XML was inspired by the example of the ATLAS
experiment at CERN, and the availability of open-source parsing tools for
constructing interfaces to the above-listed client applications that we
need to write.  The
<A HREF="http://atlasinfo.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/GRAPHICS/Texts/Documentation/XMLScene/XMLinAtlas.html">
ALTAS AGGD</A> web page is a great help in getting started with this project.
A CERN workshop on the general problem of detector geometry specification
was held April 14, 2000.  The transparencies and video recording
of the talks is found on CERN's web site at the

<P><LI>Where it is now:<BR>
A first draft of the geometry specification for Hall D is now in place.
The document is spread across everal files, one for each subsystem.  All
of the files have been checked for well-formedness and validated against
the schema.  The following are available for browsing, but are
still very much under development.  The best way to look at these files
is with a XML-enabled browser like IE6, Mozilla or Netscape 6.
