c This is the control file for the GEANT simulation.  Parameters defined
c in this file control the kind and extent of simulation that is performed.
c The full list of options is given in section BASE-40 of the GEANT manual.
c
c In addition, some new cards have been defined to set up the input source
c for the simulation.  Three kinds of simulation runs are available, selected
c by which of the following three "cards" are present below.
c    1. Input from Monte Carlo generator (card INFILE)
c    2. Built-in coherent bremsstrahlung source (card BEAM)
c    3. Built-in single-track event generator (card KINE)
c The order of the list is significant, that is if INFILE is present then the
c BEAM and KINE cards are ignored, otherwise if BEAM is present then KINE is
c ignored.  For example, the 3-card sequence:
c     INFILE 'phi-1680.hddm'
c     SKIP 25
c     TRIG 100
c instructs HDGeant to open ./phi-1680.hddm, skip the first 25 events and then
c process the following 100 input events and stop.  If the end of the file is
c reached before the event count specified in card TRIG is exhausted then the
c processing will stop at the end of file.
TRIG 50000
cINFILE 'rhop.hddm'
cBEAM 12. 9.

c Commenting out the following line will disable simulated hits output.
OUTFILE 'hdgeant.hddm'

c The following card enables single-track generation (for testing).
c For a single-particle gun, set the momentum (GeV/c), direction
c theta,phi (degrees) and vertex position (cm), and for the particle
c type insert the Geant particle type code plus 100 (eg. 101=gamma,
c 103=electron, 107=pi0, 108=pi+, 109=pi-, 114=proton).  If you use
c the particle code but do not add 100 then theta,phi are ignored
c and the particle direction is generated randomly over 4pi sr.
c For a listing of the Geant particle types, see the following URL.
c http://wwwasdoc.web.cern.ch/wwwasdoc/geant_html3/node72.html
c The meaning of the arguments to KINE are as follows.
c  - particle = GEANT particle type of primary track + 100
c  - momentum = initial track momentum, central value (GeV/c)
c  - theta = initial track polar angle, central value (degrees)
c  - phi = initial track azimuthal angle, central value (degrees)
c  - delta_momentum = spread in initial track momentum, full width (GeV/c)
c  - delta_theta = spread in initial track polar angle, full width (degrees)
c  - delta_phi = spread in initial track azimuthal angle, full width (degrees)
c

KINE   148      1.0       10.35   0.      0.              0.        360.

c The SCAP card determines the vertex position for the particle gun.  It
c supports the following three arguments, all of which default to 0.
c
c    vertex_x vertex_y vertex_z
SCAP    0.       0.      65.

c If you specify a non-zero value for vertex_x and/or vertex_y above then
c all tracks will emerge from the given point.  If you leave them at zero,
c you have the option of specifying the HALO card which causes the simulation
c to generate events with a transverse profile modeled after the 12 GeV
c electron beam.  The argument only argument to HALO is fhalo, the fraction
c of the beam that lies in the halo region surrounding the core gaussian.
c The nominal value taken from CASA technical note JLAB-TN-06-048 is 5e-5.
c This card is only effective for electron beam simulations with gxtwist.

c The following lines control the rate (GHz) of background beam photons
c that are overlayed on each event in the simulation, in addition to the
c particles produced by the standard generation mechanism.  A value of
c 1.10 corresponds to nominal GlueX running conditions at an intensity of
c 10^7 tagged photons on target per second.  To disable the generation of
c random beam background, comment this line out or set the value of BGRATE
c to zero.  Background beam photons are generated during the time interval
c given by the BGGATE card, whose two arguments specify the earliest and
c latest times (ns relative to the time of the original photon that caused
c the event) that a random beam photon could produce background hits
c somewhere in the detector.  Note that for this to work, the BEAM card
c must be present (see above).  This means that background generation is
c disabled when the simulation operates in particle gun mode.

c The following card seeds the random number generator so it must be unique
c for each run.  There are two ways to specify the random see for a run.
c  1. One argument, must be an integer in the range [1,215]
c  2. Two arguments, must be a pair of positive Integer*4 numbers
c In the first case, one of a limited set of prepared starting seeds is
c chosen from a list.  These seeds have been certified to produce random
c sequences that do not repeat within the first 10^9 or so random numbers.
c For cases where more choices are needed, the two-argument form gives
c access to a total of 2^62 choices, with no guarantees about closed loops.

c The following line controls a set of generic flags that are used to
c control aspects of the simulation generally related to debugging.
c For normal debugging runs these should be left at zero (or omitted).
c At present the following functionality is defined (assumes debug on).
c  SWIT(2) = 0 turns off trajectory tracing
c          = 2 turns on step-by-step trace during tracking (verbose!)
c          = 3 turns on trajectory plotting after tracking is done
c          = 4 turns on step-by-step plotting during tracking
c  SWIT(3) = 1 stores track trajectories for plotting after tracking is done
c  SWIT(4) = 0 trace trajectories of all particle types
c          = 3 trace only charged particle trajectories

c The following cards are needed if optical photons are being
c being generated and tracked in the simulation.  The CKOV directive
c enables Cerenkov generation in materials for which the refractive
c index table has been specified.  The LABS card enables absorption
c of optical photons.  The ABAN directive controls a special feature
c of Geant which allows it to "abandon" tracking of charged particles
c once their remaining range drops below the distance to the next
c discrete interaction or geometric boundary.  Particles abandoned
c during tracking are stopped immediately and dump all remaining energy
c where they lie.  The remaining energy is dumped in the correct volume
c so this is OK in most cases, but it can cut into the yield of
c Cerenkov photons (eg. in a lead glass calorimeter) at the end of
c a particle track.  If this might be important, set ABAN to 0.

LABS 1

c The following card prevents GEANT tracking code from abandoning the
c tracking of particles near the end of their range, once it determines
c that their fate is just to stop (i.e. electrons and protons).  This
c behaviour is normal in most cases, but in the case of Cerenkov light
c generation it leads to an underestimate for the yields.
c   ABAN 1	abandon stopping tracks (default)
c   ABAN 0	do not abandon stopping tracks
ABAN 0

c The following card sets up the simulation to perform debugging on
c a subset of the simulated events.
c DEBUG first last step
c  - first (int) = event number of first event to debug
c  - last (int) = event number of last event to debug
c  - step (int) = only debug one event every step events

c The following card can be used to turn off generation of secondary
c particles in the simulation, ordinarily it should be 0 (or omitted).
