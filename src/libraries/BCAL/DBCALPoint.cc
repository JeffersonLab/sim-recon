  //1) Consider a cluster with a true position of z=400 cm (where the
  //downstream end of the BCAL is at 407 cm). Say we have three points, one each
  //at z=380 cm, 400 cm, 420 cm. If we force the latter point inside the BCAL
  //the average of the z-positions will be biased toward the upstream direction.
  //2) A point reconstructed at "410 cm" should not be treated equivalently to
  //a point reconstructed at "430 cm", though these would both be truncated to
  //407 cm. The latter should be more likely to
  //match a cluster at 390 cm.

  //and averaging.
